#1. The "Policy" Part of the GitHub Enabled Policy

Just need to keep re-writing and refining the MS Word docs to make them fit the current situation.  This afternoon I will port in the underlying detailed content (as it stands now) and was thinking it would be fun / educational / innovative / thrilling to have the three of us (plus whomever else we may want I guess) to actually use GitHub to iterate the policy draft.  Of course! 

There will probably need to be a method/convention to designate which content is just draft/prospective(for comment, etc) vs which is considered finalized in live form.  Maybe there should be a full repo or files with a special name and internal tags indicating "draft" or "proposed for comment" status vs "final" or "stable" or something.  Rather than make it read exactly like "enacted" and "amended" maybe words like "alpha" "beta" "version x" and "prototype" or "pilot" status would be closer models?


#2 The "GitHub" Part of the GitHub Enabled Policy

a) Input processes: Looking for some way to ease contributions and other interactions and render then all purely wonderfully data expressed within the GitHub system and repository itself.  Maybe using a form or something to make it easier for non-techies to make suggestions or join the contribution binge about to happen.  Relatedly, we need to actually model the issue tracker and amendment/pull-request-merge process closely on GitHub to express it as narrative guidelines on the "how to use GitHub to get to, ask about or help us amend/evolve our policy" page, 

b) Output processes: Maybe using GitHub pages or gist files or something to get the authoritative policy "files" in .md format hosted at GitHub onto proper websites or showing up as proper data-driven services to feed dynamic content in downstream apps/services.  Probably getting to the "here is a an iFrame so you can embed the policy content and it's always gonna be current" would be good enough to launch but I'd like to avoid requiring anybody who just wants to see policy to also need to actually go to GitHub and need to see/understand all the GitHub framing and options, etc.  unless they enjoy that sort of thing
