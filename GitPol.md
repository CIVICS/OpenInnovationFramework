#Use of GitHub for Policy and Guidelines

This is the placeholder practices and processes used for GitHub policy and guidelines (how to use issues and pull requests to ask questions, make comments, propose amendments, etc and how to follow or integrate into your apps or services the relevant policies that apply to your use of City of Boston open data or other relevant and applicable resources...).

The content contained in this Github repository https://github.com/CityOfBoston/OpenInnovationFramework is sufficiently accurate and reliable such that the CIO deems it the official statement of Boston's Open Innovation Framework. The wiki version of this Open Government Framework may be referenced as an unofficial informational resource.
